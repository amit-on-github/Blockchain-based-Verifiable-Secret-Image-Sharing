# 📸 Blockchain-based Verifiable Secret Image Sharing using Homomorphic Encryption

![Project Banner](images/original.png)

## 🔍 Project Overview

This project provides a **secure, decentralized, and verifiable method to share sensitive images** (such as medical X-rays) using a combination of:
- ✅ **Shamir’s Secret Sharing**
- ✅ **Homomorphic Encryption**
- ✅ **Feldman’s Verifiable Secret Sharing (VSS)**
- ✅ **Blockchain (Ethereum)** for public commitment storage & verification.

---

## 🎯 Key Features

- **Decentralized Architecture**: No single point of failure.
- **Computation on Encrypted Data**: Enables operations without revealing the secret.
- **Share Integrity Verification**: Automatically handled by smart contracts.
- **Application Example**: Secure patient image sharing in healthcare.
